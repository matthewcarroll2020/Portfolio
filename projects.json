I originally built our website by hardcoding it from scratch with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to establish an online presence. While the initial website was on a good track, we quickly realized that maintaining and scaling it as our business grew would demand more time than we could reasonably commit. To streamline operations, we migrated the site to Squarespace, which provided built-in e-commerce tools, responsive templates, and secure payment integrations. This allowed us to focus our energy on product development and business growth, while still maintaining a professional online storefront.",
